## Chapter 8: Earth as a Planet

### I. The Global Perspective and Earth's Interior Structure

**A. Learning Goals**
*   To understand what Earth is like on the inside.
*   To explain why Earth’s interiors create magnetic fields.
*   To describe the components of Earth’s interior and how scientists determined its structure.

**B. General Properties of Earth**
*   Earth is a medium-size planet.
*   It is composed primarily of heavy elements such as iron, silicon, and oxygen.
*   Earth is the only planet known to be "just right" for the development of life, neither too hot nor too cold.
*   Key measurements include a diameter of approximately **12,760 kilometers** (Radius: 6378 km) and a density of 5.514 $\text{g/cm}^{3}$.

**C. Internal Structure (Core, Mantle, Crust)**
*   The interior structure is determined indirectly using **seismic waves** (vibrations) that travel through the planet.
*   All terrestrial worlds share the basic structure of a core, mantle, and crust.
*   The material is separated by density, a process called **differentiation**.
    *   Differentiation requires the planet to be a mix of materials of different density, and the material inside must be able to flow.
    *   Gravity pulls high-density material to the center, and lower-density material rises to the surface.

| Layer | Density | Composition/Characteristics | Depth/Thickness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core** | Highest density | Nickel and iron. Inner core is solid, outer core is liquid. | Reaches 7000 km in diameter. |
| **Mantle** | Moderate density (3.5–5 $\text{g/cm}^{3}$) | Silicon, oxygen, etc.. Mostly solid, but soft enough to deform and flow slowly. | Approximately 2900 km depth. |
| **Crust** | Lowest density (3 $\text{g/cm}^{3}$) | Continental crust is predominantly **granite** (45% of surface). Oceanic crust is predominantly **basalt** (55% of surface). | Continental: 20–70 km thick; Oceanic: about 6 km thick. |
*   **Lithosphere:** The planet’s outer layer of cool, rigid rock that "floats" on the warmer, softer rock beneath.

**D. Interior Heat and Magnetic Fields**
*   **Interior heat** drives geological activity.
    *   Heat sources when young were accretion and differentiation.
    *   The **most important heat source today is radioactive decay**.
    *   Heat is transported by **convection** (hot material rises, cool material falls) and **conduction** (heat transfer from hot to cool material).
*   **Magnetic Field (Magnetosphere):**
    *   A world can have a magnetic field if charged particles are moving inside.
    *   **Three requirements** for a magnetic field: **Molten interior**, **convection**, and **moderately rapid rotation**.
    *   The field is generated by moving material in Earth’s liquid metallic core.
    *   The magnetic field protects Earth from the **solar wind** (charged particles from the Sun).
    *   When solar wind particles energize the upper atmosphere near the magnetic poles, an **aurora** is caused.

### II. Earth's Crust and Geological Activity

**A. Types of Rock**
*   **Igneous rock:** Rock that has cooled from a molten state (e.g., oceanic basalt and continental granite).
*   **Sedimentary rock:** Fragments of existing rock or shells cemented together without melting.
*   **Metamorphic rock:** Rock that has been physically or chemically altered by high temperature or pressure.
*   **Primitive rock:** The original rock from which the planetary system was made.

**B. Geological Processes**
*   **Volcanism:** Eruption of molten rock onto the surface.
    *   Molten rock is called **magma** until it reaches the surface, where it is called **lava**.
    *   **Runny lava** creates flat lava plains; slightly thicker lava creates broad **shield volcanoes**; and the thickest lava creates steep **stratovolcanoes**.
    *   Volcanism releases gases from Earth’s interior into the atmosphere. The Hawaiian islands are formed where a plate moves over a volcanic hot spot.
*   **Impact Cratering:** Caused by asteroids or comets.
    *   Most cratering occurred early in the solar system, within the first billion years.
    *   A surface with many craters indicates little geological change over 3 billion years.
*   **Tectonics:** Disruption of a planet’s surface by internal stresses.
    *   **Tectonic forces** are created by the convection of the mantle.
    *   Compression of the crust creates mountain ranges (e.g., the Himalayas).
    *   Valleys can form where the crust is pulled apart.
*   **Erosion:** Surface changes made by wind, water, or ice.

**C. Plate Tectonics**
*   The movement of continents (**continental drift**) was inspired by the puzzle-like fit of the continents, which is now confirmed by measurements of plate motion using GPS.
*   Plate tectonics is responsible for **subduction, seafloor spreading, mountains, rifts, and earthquakes**.
    *   **Seafloor Spreading (Rift Zones):** Plates pull apart, often along mid-ocean ridges, and mantle material erupts. The Red Sea is formed where plates are pulling apart.
    *   **Subduction Zones:** When one plate sinks beneath another, typically recycling oceanic crust into the mantle. This is associated with significant geological activity.
    *   **Fault Zones:** Plate boundaries marked by cracks where movement occurs. The San Andreas fault in California is a major plate boundary, and plate motions can cause **earthquakes**.

### III. Earth's Atmosphere and Climate

**A. Atmosphere Basics**
*   An **atmosphere** is a layer of gas that surrounds a world.
*   It consists mostly of molecular **nitrogen** ($N_2$) and **oxygen** ($O_2$).
*   Most of Earth’s gas is concentrated near the surface, less than 10 kilometers up.
*   **Gas pressure** depends on both density and temperature. Pressure and density decrease with altitude.
*   The atmosphere creates pressure necessary for liquid water to exist on the surface.

**B. The Greenhouse Effect**
*   The greenhouse effect is the mechanism by which the atmosphere makes planetary surfaces warmer.
*   Visible light passes through the atmosphere and warms the surface.
*   Atmospheric molecules then **absorb infrared light** (thermal radiation) emitted by the surface, thereby trapping the heat.
*   Without the greenhouse effect, Earth would be about **31°C colder** (below freezing on average).
*   A planet’s surface temperature is determined by the balance of incoming sunlight absorbed and outgoing thermal radiation.
*   **Albedo** (reflectivity) is the fraction of incoming sunlight reflected. If Earth were more reflective, its temperature would go down.

**C. Atmospheric Layers by Altitude**
*   Atmospheric properties vary based on how atmospheric gases interact with sunlight at different altitudes.

| Layer | Characteristics | Heating Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Troposphere** | Lowest layer; temperature drops with altitude. | Warmed by infrared light from the surface and convection. |
| **Stratosphere** | Layer above the troposphere; temperature generally rises with altitude (in the lower part). Contains the **ozone layer**. | Warmed by absorption of ultraviolet sunlight. |
| **Thermosphere** | About 100 kilometers altitude; temperature rises with altitude. | X rays and ultraviolet light from the Sun heat and ionize gases. |
| **Exosphere** | Highest layer, where atmosphere gradually fades into space. | Warmed by X rays and UV light; atoms can escape. |

**D. Scattering of Light**
*   The sky is blue because **air molecules scatter blue light more than red light** from the Sun.
*   Sunsets are red because red light scatters less.

**E. Weather and Climate**
*   **Weather** refers to the instantaneous conditions and circulation of the atmosphere.
*   **Climate** refers to the effects of the atmosphere that last through decades and centuries, describing accumulation of changes over long periods.

**Analogy for Differentiation:**
The process of differentiation within a planet, where density separates layers, is similar to making salad dressing: when left standing, the heavy ingredients (like iron and nickel in the Core) sink to the bottom, while the lighter ingredients (like oils/silicon in the Crust) float to the top.
